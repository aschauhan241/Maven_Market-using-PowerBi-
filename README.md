In this project, I created a comprehensive Power BI report for Maven Market, 
showcasing various data analysis and visualization techniques. 
I started by connecting to multiple CSV files and performing data transformations, 
such as merging columns, extracting values, and creating conditional columns. 
I established relationships between tables and ensured proper cardinality and filter context. 
I added calculated columns and measures to derive meaningful insights, including total transactions, returns, revenue, 
and profit. Additionally, I designed interactive visuals, including a matrix, KPI cards, maps, treemaps, and column charts, 
to display key performance indicators and trends. I applied formatting, conditional formatting, 
and drill-down capabilities to enhance the report's visual appeal and interactivity.
